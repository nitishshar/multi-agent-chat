- **Loans and Receivables**: Increased to **$13 million** from **$6 million** at the end of 2023.

- **Investments**: Decreased by **15%** to **$247,309 million**, driven mainly by:
  - **Government of Canada Securities**: Declined by **$39,950 million** due to bond maturities.
  - **Securities Repo Operations**: Reduced by **$2,904 million** as the volume of these operations decreased.

- **Derivatives – Indemnity Agreements with the Government of Canada**: Valued at **$24,604 million**, representing net unrealized losses on assets acquired through various purchase programs. This reflects a **$1,198 million** increase during the six-month period, mainly due to a slight increase in long-term bond yields.

- **Deposits**: Declined by **19%** to **$158,496 million**, reflecting continued balance sheet normalization.

## Results of Operations

The Bank incurred net losses of **$910 million** and **$1,844 million** for the three- and six-month periods ended June 30, 2024, respectively. These losses were primarily due to interest expenses on deposits exceeding interest revenue from investments, a result of the Bank's policy rate adjustments.

### Interest Revenue and Expense

- **Interest Revenue**: Decreased by **$146 million** (14%) in Q2 2024 compared to Q2 2023, and by **$242 million** (12%) over the six-month period, attributed to lower average holdings of interest-yielding investments.

- **Interest Expense**: Decreased by **$728 million** (31%) in Q2 2024 and by **$1,409 million** (30%) over the six-month period, primarily due to a lower average volume of deposits.

### Operating Expenses

Total operating expenses increased by **$3 million** (2%) in Q2 2024 and by **$12 million** (4%) over the six-month period compared to the same periods in 2023. Key factors include:

- **Staff Costs**: Increased due to higher salaries and benefits.

- **Technology and Telecommunications**: Increased, driven by investments in system resilience and retail payments supervision.

- **Bank Note Research, Production, and Processing**: Decreased due to reduced printing volumes.

- **Other Operating Expenses**: Decreased, mainly due to the completion of outsourced contracts and a shift to internal solutions.

### Comprehensive Income

Other comprehensive income for the six-month period was **$133 million**, including:

- **Remeasurement Gains**: **$101 million** on defined-benefit plans, due to an increase in the fair value of plan assets and higher discount rates.
