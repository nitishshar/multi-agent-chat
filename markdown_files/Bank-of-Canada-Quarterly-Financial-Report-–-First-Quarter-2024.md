### Asset Breakdown

- **Cash and Foreign Deposits**: Held steady at **$12 million**, compared to **$14 million** at the end of 2023.

- **Loans and Receivables**: Increased to **$9 million** from **$6 million** at the end of 2023.

- **Investments**: Decreased by **12%** to **$253,913 million**, driven mainly by:
  - **Government of Canada Securities**: Declined due to bond maturities.
  - **Securities Repo Operations**: Reduced as the volume of these operations decreased.

- **Derivatives – Indemnity Agreements with the Government of Canada**: Valued at **$25,802 million**, representing net unrealized losses on assets acquired through various purchase programs. This reflects an increase during the three-month period, mainly due to changes in market conditions.

### Liabilities and Deficiency

- **Bank Notes in Circulation**: Decreased slightly to **$118,834 million**, representing approximately **42%** of total liabilities.

- **Deposits**: Declined by **16%** to **$165,288 million**, reflecting continued balance sheet normalization.

- **Securities Sold Under Repurchase Agreements**: Decreased by **36%** to **$4,265 million**, representing the repurchase price for securities repo operations and overnight reverse repo operations.

- **Deficiency**: Increased to **$6,660 million** due to comprehensive losses of **$814 million** for the first three months of the year. The accumulated deficit as of March 31, 2024, was **$7,672 million**.

## Results of Operations

The Bank incurred a net loss of **$934 million** for the three-month period ended March 31, 2024, primarily because interest expenses on deposits exceeded interest revenue from investments. This net interest expense resulted from the Bank increasing its policy rate from **0.25%** in the first quarter of 2022 to **5.00%** in the third quarter of 2023. Over time, the Bank is expected to resume generating net income. These net losses do not affect the Bank’s ability to carry out its mandate.

### Interest Revenue and Expense

- **Interest Revenue**: Decreased by **$96 million** (10%) in Q1 2024 compared to Q1 2023, attributed to lower average holdings of interest-yielding investments.

- **Interest Expense**: Decreased by **$681 million** (29%) in Q1 2024 compared to Q1 2023, primarily due to a lower average volume of deposits.

### Operating Expenses

Total operating expenses increased by **$9 million** (6%) in Q1 2024 compared to the same period in 2023. Key factors include:

- **Staff Costs**: Increased by **$15 million** (17%), due to higher salaries and benefits.

- **Technology and Telecommunications**: Increased, driven by investments in system resilience and retail payments supervision.

- **Bank Note Research, Production, and Processing**: Decreased due to reduced printing volumes.

- **Other Operating Expenses**: Decreased, mainly due to the completion of outsourced contracts and a shift to internal solutions.

### Comprehensive Income

Other comprehensive income for the three-month period was **$120 million**, including:

- **Remeasurement Gains**: **$107 million** on defined-benefit plans, due to an increase in the fair value of plan assets and higher discount rates.

- **Fair Value Increase**: **$13 million** in the Bank's investment in the Bank for International Settlements.
