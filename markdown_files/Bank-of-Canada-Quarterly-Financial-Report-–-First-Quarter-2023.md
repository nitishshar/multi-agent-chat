### Asset Breakdown

- **Loans and Receivables**: Held steady at **$5 million**, unchanged from December 31, 2022.

- **Investments**: Decreased by **9%** to **$344,766 million**, driven mainly by:
  - **Government of Canada Securities**: Declined due to bond maturities.
  - **Securities Repo Operations**: Reduced as the volume of these operations decreased.

- **Derivatives – Indemnity Agreements with the Government of Canada**: Valued at **$31,346 million**, representing net unrealized losses on assets acquired through various purchase programs. This reflects a slight increase during the three-month period, mainly due to changes in market conditions.

### Liabilities and Deficiency

- **Bank Notes in Circulation**: Slightly decreased to **$118,834 million**, representing approximately **32%** of total liabilities.

- **Deposits**: Declined by **11%** to **$243,365 million**, reflecting continued balance sheet normalization.

- **Securities Sold Under Repurchase Agreements**: Decreased by **39%** to **$10,581 million**, representing the repurchase price for securities repo operations and overnight reverse repo operations.

- **Deficiency**: Increased to **$3,931 million** due to comprehensive losses of **$1,535 million** for the first three months of the year. The accumulated deficit as of March 31, 2023, was **$5,012 million**.

## Results of Operations

The Bank incurred a net loss of **$1,510 million** for the three-month period ended March 31, 2023, primarily because interest expenses on deposits exceeded interest revenue from investments. This net interest expense resulted from the Bank increasing its policy rate from **0.25%** in the first quarter of 2022 to **4.50%** in the first quarter of 2023. Over time, the Bank is expected to resume generating net income. These net losses do not affect the Bank’s ability to carry out its mandate. citeturn0search0

### Interest Revenue and Expense

- **Interest Revenue**: Decreased by **$98 million** (9%) in Q1 2023 compared to Q1 2022, attributed to lower average holdings of interest-yielding investments.

- **Interest Expense**: Increased by **$1,939 million** (510%) in Q1 2023 compared to Q1 2022, primarily due to rises in the Bank’s policy interest rate.

### Operating Expenses

Total operating expenses decreased by **5%** in Q1 2023 compared to the same period in 2022. Key factors include:

- **Staff Costs**: Decreased by **$6 million** (6%), due to:
  - **Salary Costs**: Increased by **$6 million** as vacancies were filled and annual compensation adjustments were made.
  - **Benefits and Other Staff Costs**: Decreased by **$12 million**, mainly due to a decline in the expense associated with the Bank’s defined-benefit plans, resulting from a rise in the discount rates used for their calculation.

- **Bank Note Research, Production, and Processing**: Decreased by **$10 million** (77%), driven by lower volumes of bank notes being printed. The timing of bank note production varies based on the annual production plan and market demand.

- **Technology and Telecommunications**: Increased by **$5 million** (22%), driven by the Bank’s focus on digital transformation and strengthening information technology systems.

### Comprehensive Income

Other comprehensive loss for the three-month period was **$25 million**, including:

- **Remeasurement Losses**: **$35 million** on defined-benefit plans, due to decreases in discount rates, offset by an increase in the fair value of the plans’ assets.

- **Fair Value Increase**: **$10 million** in the Bank's investment in the Bank for International Settlements.
