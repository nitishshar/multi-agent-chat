## Results of Operations

The Bank reported net losses of **$732 million** and **$2,576 million** for the three- and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024, respectively. These losses are primarily due to interest expenses on deposits exceeding interest revenue from investments, a result of the Bank's policy rate adjustments.

### Interest Revenue and Expense

- **Interest Revenue**: Slight decrease of **$1 million** (0%) in Q3 2024 compared to Q3 2023, and a **$243 million** (8%) decline over the nine-month period, attributed to lower average holdings of interest-yielding investments.

- **Interest Expense**: Decreased by **$737 million** (33%) in Q3 2024 and **$2,146 million** (31%) over the nine-month period, primarily due to a lower average volume of deposits.

### Operating Expenses

Total operating expenses increased by **$9 million** (5%) in Q3 2024 and **$21 million** (4%) over the nine-month period compared to the same periods in 2023. Key factors include:

- **Staff Costs**: Increased by **$23 million** (30%) in Q3 and **$51 million** (20%) over nine months, due to higher salaries and benefits.

- **Technology and Telecommunications**: Increased by **$4 million** (14%) in Q3 and **$10 million** (12%) over nine months, driven by investments in system resilience and retail payments supervision.

- **Bank Note Research, Production, and Processing**: Decreased by **$13 million** (81%) in Q3 and **$25 million** (83%) over nine months, due to reduced printing volumes.

- **Other Operating Expenses**: Decreased by **$3 million** (17%) in Q3 and **$11 million** (20%) over nine months, mainly due to the completion of outsourced contracts and a shift to internal solutions.

### Comprehensive Income

Other comprehensive income for the nine-month period was **$144 million**, including:

- **Remeasurement Gains**: **$89 million** on defined-benefit plans, due to an increase in the fair value of plan assets and higher discount rates.

## 2024 Financial Forecast

The Bank's forecasted expenditures for 2024 total **$714 million**, slightly exceeding the budgeted **$707 million**. The increase is mainly due to higher staff costs, reflecting increased expenses related to defined-benefit pension plans.
