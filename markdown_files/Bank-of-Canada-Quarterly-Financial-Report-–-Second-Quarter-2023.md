### Asset Breakdown

- **Loans and Receivables**: Increased to **$4 million** from **$5 million** at the end of 2022.

- **Investments**: Decreased by **13%** to **$327,560 million**, driven mainly by:

  - **Securities Repo Operations**: Reduced as the volume of these operations decreased.

- **Derivatives – Indemnity Agreements with the Government of Canada**: Valued at **$28,834 million**, representing net unrealized losses on assets acquired through various purchase programs. This reflects an increase during the six-month period, mainly due to changes in market conditions.

## Results of Operations

The Bank incurred net losses of **$1,492 million** and **$3,002 million** for the three- and six-month periods ended June 30, 2023, respectively. These losses were primarily due to interest expenses on deposits exceeding interest revenue from investments, a result of the Bank's policy rate adjustments.

### Interest Revenue and Expense

- **Interest Revenue**: Decreased by **$154 million** (13%) in Q2 2023 compared to Q2 2022, and by **$252 million** (11%) over the six-month period, attributed to lower average holdings of interest-yielding investments.

- **Interest Expense**: Increased by **$1,497 million** in Q2 2023 and by **$3,436 million** over the six-month period, primarily due to rises in the Bank’s policy interest rate.

### Operating Expenses

Total operating expenses decreased by **8%** in Q2 2023 and by **6%** over the six-month period compared to the same periods in 2022. Key factors include:

- **Staff Costs**: Decreased by **$7 million** (7%) in Q2 and by **$13 million** (7%) over six months, due to a decline in benefit expenses.

- **Bank Note Research, Production, and Processing**: Decreased by **$5 million** (31%) in Q2 and by **$15 million** (52%) over six months, due to reduced printing volumes.

- **Technology and Telecommunications**: Decreased by **$3 million** (11%) in Q2 but increased by **$2 million** (4%) over six months, driven by investments in system resilience and retail payments supervision.

### Comprehensive Income

Other comprehensive loss for the six-month period was **$39 million**, including:
